        During my first internship at Amazon, I had the opportunity to work on the
        <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/'>AWS Aurora</a> team as a Software Engineer. My project consisted of building an upcoming customer facing logging feature for the platform, integrating with multiple AWS services. At the end of my internship, I was presented with a return offer for a second internship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of my second internship, I worked within Last Mile Technologies, joining the <a href='https://flex.amazon.com'>Amazon Flex</a> team. My project consisted of implementing a daily report to evaluate delivery driver performance datasets. RESTFul APIs were devleoped, allowing the report to be utilized within the overall deliver driver performance scorecard. At the end of my internship, I was presented with a return offer for a full time position.
      </p>
      <p>
        I returned as a full-time Software Development Engineer I within Last Mile Technologies once again in the early summer of 2019. I joined a small team maintaining and improving legacy services used to evaluate route and package execution data worldwide, resulting in the payment of Delivery Service Providers. I also led the architecture design and development of a brand new service. This unlocked the ability to precisely track the number of hours worked by delivery drivers, enforce daily work hour limits, and enforce breaks to be taken. In December of 2020, I was promoted to an SDE II.
